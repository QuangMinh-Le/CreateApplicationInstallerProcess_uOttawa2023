# Process to create an Application Installer Package

---

### ** üìù Essential terminologies before getting start: **
| Terminology | Definition |
| :---: | --- |
| <b>Group <br> --- <br> Subgroup <br> --- <br> Project</b> |  The relationship between these entities is hierarchical. A **group** can contain multiple subgroups, and each **subgroup** can contain multiple **projects** (similar to repositories in github). |
| **Fork** | <b>Forking</b> is the process of creating a copy of a project under your own account or namespace. It allows you to make changes to the codebase without affecting the original project. Forks are often used for contributing to open-source projects or experimenting with modifications. |
| **Merge** | <b>Merging</b> is the process of combining changes from one project into another. In GitLab, you can merge projects to consolidate code changes. For example, merging a fork project into the original project incorporates the new feature into the original codebase. |
| **Merge Request** |  A <b>merge request</b> (also known as a pull request) is a proposal to merge changes from one project into another. It is a way to review and discuss code changes before they are merged. Merge requests provide a collaborative workflow, allowing team members to review, comment, and suggest modifications. |
